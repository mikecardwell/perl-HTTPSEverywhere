NAME
    HTTPSEverywhere -- Use the rulesets generated for HTTPS-Everywhere from
    Perl.

DESCRIPTION
    HTTPS Everywhere is a Firefox addon which forces users to use https for
    certain websites. This Perl module was written to take advantage of the
    rulesets generated for that project. You need to download the rules
    separately.

    Project page:

      https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere

    Obtain the repository and rules from Git:

      git clone git://git.torproject.org/https-everywhere.git

    This project is currently under heavy development and the format of the
    rulesets are likely to change. This module may stop working because of
    that. I will endeavour to keep it up to date with the latest ruleset
    format.

EXAMPLES
      my $he = new HTTPSEverywhere(
         rulesets => [
            '/git/https-everywhere/src/chrome/content/rules',
         ],
      );
      my $url = $he->convert('http://gmail.com/foo');

      In this example, $url would contain https://mail.google.com/foo

METHODS
    new( rulesets = \@paths ))>
          "rulesets" contains a list of paths to the directory or directories
          containing the xml ruleset files

    read( @paths )
          Clears out the known rulesets and reads them from each of the
          directories in @paths. If @paths is not provided, it re-reads
          them from the paths specified in new().

    convert( $url )
          Returns the converted version of the URL. If no rules match the
          URL, the original URL is returned.
